            Hello there! Here is a little general info about me: I was born in Texas, but I grew up in Oregon and Utah.
            After graduating high school, in Texas (long story), I moved around a lot. About a dozen times in the last 10 years.
            I've lived in 7 states: Texas, Oregon, Utah, Idaho, California, Florida, and now Colorado.
            I studied Music and a little Psychology at BYU-Idaho for a few years before transferring down to Texas Woman's University.
            I graduated from TWU with my BFA in Visual Arts concentration Graphic Design in 2017 and got a job as a Junior Designer at CosmoProf beauty just after graduation.
            <br>
            <br>
            Since then I have had some adventures. I quit my job as a designer at the beginning of 2018 and moved to South Korea to teach English. It was a mostly awesome experience, except for the job part. More on that if asked.
            I ended up leaving Korea after about 5 months and moving back here to the states to live with my sisters in Utah. I tried to get back into Graphic Design while I was living there, but to no avail.
            <br>
            <br>
            Then in May of this year, I decided I would move out of Utah in June, I just had to figure out where. I took a short road trip up to Washington to check out a Masters program I was interested in, 
            and then an even shorter weekend trip here to Denver to visit my brother and his wife who moved here the first week of May.
            On that short trip I decided Denver was where I needed to be, so I found a place to live and moved out here the next week.
            I've been working at the Amazon warehouse in Aurora to pay the bills, and then I heard about this Coding Bootcamp a couple months ago, and now here I am.
